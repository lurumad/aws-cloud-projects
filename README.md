# AWS Cloud Project with AWS CDK (TypeScript)

Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Project** repository! This project leverages the **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)** with **TypeScript** to define and provision cloud infrastructure using code. It demonstrates real-world examples for deploying scalable and secure AWS solutions. Also, it provides a way to automate the deployment of AWS resources using **GitHub Actions**.

I've been insprired by the [AWS Cloud Projects: Strengthen your AWS skills through practical projects, from websites to advanced AI application](https://www.amazon.com/AWS-Cloud-Projects-Strengthen-applications/dp/B0DGTDD2YB) book by Ivo Pinto and Pedro Santos.

I will be adding more projects to this repository as I progress through the book and I will add my own projects as well.

Every project will be deployed using **GitHub Actions** and **AWS CDK**.
